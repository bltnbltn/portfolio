First of all, it took me a lot of time to figure out how to use the grid, I was aware of flex display but it was my first time trying grid layout.

Then I tried to use the modal element for my logo to look bigger and clear.

I split the three js file so that I can easily distinguish each function.

I replaced the font for the main heading with a webfont, instead of using a font that needs to be downloaded, so that it could be loaded quicker.

I added the form element and function of sending emails from the user to my email. I was also struggling with applying that function by using SmtpJS and Elastic Email. I learned how the secret token functions which I also learned in today's class.

I'm still figuring out how to fix the favicon when each menu is clicked in the navigation.

I'm also thinking of changing the fun page shorter so it can look more simple and clear.
